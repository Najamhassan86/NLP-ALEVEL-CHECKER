**Total Marks: 10**

---

### Marking Criteria:

1. **Definition of Photosynthesis (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for stating that photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy to chemical energy
   - Award 1 mark for mentioning it occurs in plants/chloroplasts

2. **Light-Dependent Reactions (3 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for identifying that these occur in the thylakoid membranes
   - Award 1 mark for stating that light energy is captured by chlorophyll
   - Award 1 mark for mentioning the production of ATP and NADPH
   - Award 1 mark for mentioning oxygen as a byproduct (water splitting)

3. **Light-Independent Reactions / Calvin Cycle (3 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for identifying that these occur in the stroma
   - Award 1 mark for mentioning carbon dioxide fixation
   - Award 1 mark for stating that glucose/sugar is produced
   - Award 1 mark for mentioning the role of ATP and NADPH from light reactions

4. **Overall Equation (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for correct reactants (CO2 + H2O + light energy)
   - Award 1 mark for correct products (glucose + O2)
   - Full marks for: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

### Common Mistakes to Penalize:
- Confusing photosynthesis with respiration
- Incorrectly stating the location of reactions
- Omitting oxygen as a product
- Not mentioning the role of chlorophyll
