# Computer Science - Question 2
## Time Complexity Analysis

**Total Marks: 8**

---

### Marking Criteria:

1. **Big O Notation Definition (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for explaining Big O describes upper bound of algorithm runtime
   - Award 1 mark for stating it measures how runtime grows with input size

2. **Common Complexity Classes (3 marks)**
   - Award 0.5 mark each for correctly identifying and explaining:
     - O(1) - constant time
     - O(log n) - logarithmic time
     - O(n) - linear time
     - O(n log n) - linearithmic time
     - O(n²) - quadratic time
     - O(2^n) - exponential time

3. **Example Analysis (3 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for analyzing a simple loop (O(n))
   - Award 1 mark for analyzing nested loops (O(n²))
   - Award 1 mark for explaining why the complexity is what it is

---

### Expected Knowledge:
- Understanding that Big O ignores constants and lower-order terms
- Ability to identify complexity from code structure
- Recognition that nested loops multiply complexity
- Understanding of best, average, and worst-case scenarios

### Deductions:
- Confusing Big O with actual runtime
- Incorrect complexity identification
- Missing explanation or justification
- Not considering worst-case scenarios
