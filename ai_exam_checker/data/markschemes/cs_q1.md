### Marking Criteria:

1. **Encapsulation (2.5 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for defining encapsulation as bundling data and methods together
   - Award 0.5 mark for mentioning data hiding/access modifiers
   - Award 1 mark for providing a relevant example (e.g., class with private fields and public methods)

2. **Inheritance (2.5 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for defining inheritance as deriving new classes from existing ones
   - Award 0.5 mark for mentioning code reusability
   - Award 1 mark for providing an example (e.g., parent-child class relationship)

3. **Polymorphism (2.5 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for defining polymorphism as ability of objects to take multiple forms
   - Award 0.5 mark for distinguishing between compile-time (overloading) and runtime (overriding)
   - Award 1 mark for providing a relevant example

4. **Abstraction (2.5 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for defining abstraction as hiding complex implementation details
   - Award 0.5 mark for mentioning abstract classes or interfaces
   - Award 1 mark for providing a practical example

### Additional Notes:
- Examples must be relevant and correct to earn full marks
- Generic definitions without examples get partial credit only
- Must cover all four principles for full marks

### Common Errors:
- Confusing encapsulation with abstraction
- Not providing concrete examples
- Mixing up polymorphism types
