# Biology - Question 2
## Cell Division: Mitosis vs Meiosis

**Total Marks: 12**

---

### Marking Criteria:

1. **Purpose of Mitosis (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for stating mitosis produces two identical daughter cells
   - Award 1 mark for mentioning its role in growth, repair, or asexual reproduction

2. **Purpose of Meiosis (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for stating meiosis produces four non-identical daughter cells
   - Award 1 mark for mentioning its role in sexual reproduction / gamete formation

3. **Chromosome Number in Mitosis (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for stating that mitosis maintains diploid chromosome number
   - Award 1 mark for explaining that daughter cells are genetically identical to parent (2n → 2n)

4. **Chromosome Number in Meiosis (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for stating that meiosis reduces chromosome number to haploid
   - Award 1 mark for explaining the reduction (2n → n)

5. **Number of Divisions (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for stating mitosis involves one division
   - Award 1 mark for stating meiosis involves two divisions (meiosis I and II)

6. **Genetic Variation (2 marks)**
   - Award 1 mark for explaining that mitosis produces no genetic variation
   - Award 1 mark for explaining that meiosis produces genetic variation through crossing over and independent assortment

---

### Key Points:
- Clear distinction between mitosis and meiosis
- Understanding of diploid vs haploid
- Recognition of when each process occurs
- Understanding of genetic variation

### Deductions:
- Confusing mitosis with meiosis
- Incorrect chromosome numbers
- Missing key processes (crossing over, etc.)
